# Airbnb Price Optimization Project

Overview
-
This project aims to develop a price optimization model for Airbnb listings using data from the Airbnb19 API. We analyzed listing features and applied machine learning techniques to predict optimal nightly prices. The project integrates multiple data processing tools, including Hive on Google Cloud Dataproc and Python in Google Colab.

Tools & Technologies
-
Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Hive on Dataproc for data processing

Google Colab: Python-based data analysis and modeling

Apache Hive: SQL-like queries for large dataset preprocessing

Machine Learning: Regression models for price prediction
